Whitewoods - Beachwalk

She pressed her feet across the board walk
She keeps the sunset right with movement in her eyes
She knows she gets away with murder
Swallows up your heart of gold
And I don't know just where we've got to go
Whoa-oh
Whoa
Whoa-oh

This sound is giving for the postman
Another one that's feeling under aurora skies
The summer sleeps in time for autumn
Sticking down your leaves on grass
And I don't know just where we've got to go
Whoa-oh
Whoa
Whoa-oh

Kero Kero Bonito - Flamingo

How many shrimps do you have to eat
Before you make your skin turn pink?
Eat too much and you'll get sick
Shrimps are pretty rich!

Nande aitsura wa pinku?
Doubutsu-en de omou to pinku
Tabemono de, sou nanda!
Jitsu wa watashi wa tarako ga daisuki
Purasu ebi kani tabeyo
Pinku iro ni naru no
Dakara minna chigau iro
Ningen-de kanchigai
Shiteru yo ne!

Black, white, green, or blue
Show off your natural hue
Flamingo-o-o-owoah
If you're multicolored that's cool too
You don't need to change
It's boring being the same
Flamingo-o-o-owoah
You're pretty either way

Tsuru no shippo shita ni mukatte magetera
FURAMINGO
Imi fumei dakedo omoshrioi deshou
Niji iro ni somatte sekai
Kyou mo chikyuu no doko kade
Ebi wo mushamusha tabete
Furamingo wa, pinku iro ni
Somatte ikuze 1, 2, 3!

Soviet Anthem

Soyuz nerushimyy respublik svobodnykh
Splotila naveki Velikaya Rus'.
Da zdravstvuyet sozdannyy voley narodov
Yedinyy, moguchiy Sovetskiy Soyuz!

Slav'sya, Otechestvo nashe svobodnoye,
Druzhby narodov nadozhnyy oplot!
Partiya Lenina - sila narodnaya
Nas k torzhestvu kommunizma vedot!

Skvoz' grozy siyalo nam solntse svobody,
I Lenin velikiy nam put' ozaril,
Na pravoye delo on podnyal narody,
Na trud i na podvigi nas vdokhnovil.

Slav'sya, Otechestvo nashe svobodnoye,
Druzhby narodov nadozhnyy oplot!
Partiya Lenina - sila narodnaya
Nas k torzhestvu kommunizma vedot!

V pobede bessmertnykh idey kommunizma
My vidim gryadushcheye nashey strany
I Krasnomu znameni slavnoy Otchizny
My budem vsegda bezzavetno verny!

Slav'sya, Otechestvo nashe svobodnoye,
Druzhby narodov nadozhnyy oplot!
Partiya Lenina - sila narodnaya
Nas k torzhestvu kommunizma vedot!
